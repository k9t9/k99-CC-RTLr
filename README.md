## Synopsis

A small scripted utility to help with RTL text in Illustrator.

## Motivation

Why ??

Because after so many years , illustrator still does not support RTL languages . Seriously adobe ..
All it takes to flip a text is ONE LINE of code ...

So now, everyone who uses adobe products need to flip their text, usually using some external utility , or an online service .
I got tired of it , so I scripted this small utility .

Seriously, adobe ...

## Installation

You can launch directly from File -> Scripts -> Other scripts ... ( or CTRL+F12 )

If you want the script to permanently be available in illustrator , copy the folder to :

DRIVE:\%Program Files%\Adobe\Adobe Illustrator%VER%\Presets\en_US\Scripts

## Interface 

Pretty straight forward , here it is :

## Usage 

You can use this script in 3 ways :

1 - Direct typing of a text .
2 - Paste a text from clipboard 
3 - select a textframe ( before launchiing the script ) and get that selection.

Either way - after you have the text in the box, you have to click "Go" in order for the flipping to occur .

Now , again, you have a choice , either :

1 - copy the flipped text back to artboard , or ..
2 - if you have used method [3] from above ( meaning you have selecteed a textframe ) - you can click "put back to selection".
3 - [ todo / unsupported ] - click "Create text" to create a frame with the flipped text .

## ToDo

 * Flip multiple textframes at once .
 * Create a textframe ( from direct typing ) 
 * Clean some small bugs .
 * support Arabic ( with file creation )
